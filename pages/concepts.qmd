1. **If your working directory is `myfolder/homework/`, what *relative path* would you specify to get the file located at `myfolder/MyData.csv`?**  
   - `../MyData.csv`  
   - The `..` goes **up one folder** from `homework/` to `myfolder/`, then you reference `MyData.csv`.

2. **What are the major benefits of using R Projects?**  
   - Keep code, data, and outputs **organized** in one self‑contained folder.  
   - The working directory is set **automatically**, avoiding hard‑coded paths.  
   - Improves **reproducibility** and portability (easy to share or move).  
   - Plays nicely with **version control** tools like git.

3. **What is git and what is GitHub?**  
   - **Git**: a **distributed version control system** that tracks changes, supports branching/merging, and enables collaboration.  
   - **GitHub**: a **cloud platform** that hosts git repositories for sharing, collaboration, issues, pull requests, and CI/CD.

4. **What are two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame?**  
   - **(a)** Tibbles are **stricter/safer**: they do not convert strings to factors or change column names/types silently.  
   - **(b)** Tibbles **print nicely**: they show the first 10 rows and fit columns to your screen, with data types indicated.

5. **Rewrite the following nested function call using Base R’s chaining operator (`|>`):**
   
   Original (nested) call:
   ```r
   arrange(
     filter(
       select(as_tibble(iris), starts_with("Petal"), Species), 
       Petal.Length < 1.55
     ),
     Species
   )
   ```

   Using the chaining operator with tidyverse verbs:
   ```{r}
   library(tidyverse)

   iris |>
     as_tibble() |>
     select(starts_with("Petal"), Species) |>
     filter(Petal.Length < 1.55) |>
     arrange(Species)
   ```
